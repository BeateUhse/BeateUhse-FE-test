</ul>

<h4><b><i>Hints</i></b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>We know craftsmenship with CSS and pixel perfect styling is a master class on its own, but at Beate Uhse we love you even more when <i><b>structure</b></i> makes your bells ring :) So don't focus to much on the styling, makes sure your code and build process is rock solid and serves a clear purpose. Javascript is your main focus. Write the code as of something you would be proud off. </li>
  <li>Use comments to explain the underlying thinking process, better to much than to little</li>
  <li>A handy package called Faker.js is set as npm dependency.. If you feel like your structure can handle more, feel free to generate more data and include it in to your mini-app</li>
</ul>

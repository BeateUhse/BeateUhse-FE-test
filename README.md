##Frontend test for Beate Uhse (Medior/Senior)

This is a boilerplate repo for the Front-End interview test. Please fork this repository and commit the result to a repository of your own.

<h4><b><i>In this repo</i></b></h4>

<ul>
    <li>Designs of 2 e-commerce pages</li>
    <li>Fake JSON data</li>
    <li>Index.html to start with (but not required to use)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4><b><i>To do</i></b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Replicate the 2 pages as found in the <i>./img/design</i> folder, but focus on the Javascript.</li>
  <li>The Javascript app structure has to be a SPA</li>
  <li>Make use of fake products JSON data as found in the <i>./data</i> folder</li>
  <li>Use pagination to jump between product pages (example: max 10 per page, so 4 pages total)</li>
  <li>Create filters for [price, color, product], at least 1 filter type should work</li> 
  <li>Make use of a css-preprocessor (less/sass)</li> 
  <li>All JS files are compiled and minified into a single bundle using a TaskRunner</li> 
  <li>All CSS files are compiled and minified into a single bundle a TaskRunner</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4><b><i>Bonus</i></b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>3 Filters or more are working</li>
  <li>Create a (Node) REST API to fetch and filter the JSON data</li>
  <li>Write tests for the JS code</li>
  <li>Code checking is applied to build pipeline</li>
  <li>Extensive use of ES6/Typescript</li>
  <li>Build with a modern framework (React, Angular2, Backbone etc) or setup with a modern Vanilla JS structure (classes/prototypes, (web)components etc)</li>
</ul>

<h4><b><i>Hints</i></b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>To fill up the page/details you can set static data about the product, as long as some of the JSON is at least used</li>
  <li>We know craftsmenship with CSS and pixel perfect styling is a master class on its own, but at Beate Uhse we love you even more when <i><b>structure</b></i> makes your bells ring :) So don't focus to much on the styling and the design, makes sure your code and build process is rock solid and serves a clear purpose. Javascript is your main focus. Write the code as of something you would be proud off. </li>
  <li>Use comments to explain the underlying thinking process, better to much than to little</li>
  <li>A handy package called Faker.js is set as npm dependency.. If you feel like your structure can handle more, feel free to generate more data and include it in to your mini-app</li>
</ul>
